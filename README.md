# A low-profile 4x6 orthocolumnar wireless keyboard with a 5-key thumb cluster. 
It uses [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) together with the Seeed Studio XIAO BLE nRF52840.
I created it using [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen). Putting the pcb file into kiCad and routing it.
I used some of [ceoloide's](https://github.com/ceoloide/ergogen-footprints/tree/main) footprints for ergogen.
